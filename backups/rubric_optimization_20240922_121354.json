How would you feel if no one was out getting excrise, and no one was using the playgrounds, parks and beachs. Everyone will be sitting at home on there nice new fanny computers. When you really do think about how much time people spend doing nothing, just sitting around, @CAPS2 would a computer solve that problem? It really @CAPS4't. This is what I would say to having computers, People spend to much time on computers, excrise is needed, everyday, and it makes your body wear and your eyes strained. When it comes to computers everyone wants to get one, but when we say excrise it seems like peoples mind click off. This happens because people are really starting to spend lots of time on computers. If they work on computers during a long period of the day, @CAPS5 head home to spend more time on the computer, @CAPS5 whats that doing to your body? not helping it. I like computers to and I like spending time on them, when i need to get something done sometime that doesn't happen, because I get and I forget what time it is and that's not fun. Sometime this happens to people they are engaged in there computer, when someone is talking to them and your telling them something you need them to do, and there noding there head like they know what you sayed, but the next time you asked if it got done and it didn't, you know they were listening. Excrise is really important for your body and doens't even have to be to got anything, but don't spend your time wasted on computers. This happens to @NUM1 to @NUM2 or families when they come home from work or school, and jump right on the computers, families are not getting enough excrise or spending time with family because computers get in the way of that. Excrise would help to keep you instead of electronics. Computers are like little robots that control your mind and body, it sucks the life cut of you. It strains your eyes it makes you wrat and you really dont want to do a lot, maybe if people spend less time on computers and more time being more focused on families and nature, they @CAPS4't be weak and tired. I know a lot of people who @CAPS4't want computers to be banned, but I think it would help for a lot of reasons and make families closer and bodys more focused, from my experience computers do help in some ways, but when it comes to real life it helps for really no one. i hope you understand @CAPS2 I say these sort of things, but if you do care about health and activities @CAPS5 you would say that computers are not a lot of help also.",

I didn't know who he was or what he did until I looked him up on the internet. @CAPS1 second opinion is we wouldn't be able to type important paper's. I say this because people that have @CAPS3's mostly have to type paper's. And without the computers everything would have to be hand-writen. Also some people have bad hand writing. @CAPS1 last opinion is we can type to people that are online and offline. I say this because if you have to tell a family member, or a friend something important but, you phone is dead or broken you can e-mail them. Or if you have a facebook you can tell them on that.

It helps out in many ways for example, to keep in touch with relatives, to learn new information and to keep you safe and updated. Computers are vital to everyday life and we need them. A huge purpose of computers is to keep in touch. With new programs like \"@CAPS2\" and \"@CAPS3\" and \"@CAPS4\", it leaves you with all sorts of new opportunities to keep in touch and have fun with your friends that were not previously available. Email as well, is a great taol to keep in touch with family that are far away opposed to the good'ol letter which @MONTH1 take a web in the mail. Another huge reason why we need computers today is to be able to reaserch foreign places and learn facts that without a computer you would never even heard of. With computers, it makes it possible to go online, look up the @ORGANIZATION1, research it and plan a flight there a week later. It is also a great tool to learn new things that he did not know previusly. It is a huge step up in the education process. Computers also provide us with extreme saftey and security as well as breaking news. Imagine how much simpler it would be to be able to be at home and go on the computer to check the best rout home opposed not and consequently sitting intinse. With modern day technology all that is possible. They add great saftey and protection to average people like you and me. In conclusions, hopefully your mind has been changed on the topic of computers, or if you already were in support, that as well is great. Now you are being asked to spread the word about how great computers are and how vital they are to ensuring a better future.

Computers benefitted society greatly. It helps people @CAPS2 things such as allow people to talk to each other, goin skills from playing games, and it has images and it is easier. As I ,mentioned, computers allow us to communicate with other people. This way, we don't have to talk to people in person. it would get annoying if every time we wanted to talk to someone of three things would happen without computers. those would be either getting trouble at school, memorizing a phone number and the dialing it, or talking to than in person. Clearly, computers make it easier to talk to people. Next, computers allow us to talk to faraway friends or family. You could write an e-mail or talk to them in a chat. This helped me because I talk to one of my friends in @LOCATION1 and just recently sent an e-mail to my aunt. Without a doubt, computers make it easier for us to communicate with other people, no matter how far. Secondly, every computer that I have seen is able to play some sort of game, whether it be by a disk or on a website. These games can teach us many skills. The first skill we could learn is typing. just a few days ago, I was playing a game where you had @NUM1 seconds to type as many words as you can, as fast as you can. If you make a mistake one second decreases off of your time. It also gets harder as you go, getting from just three letter words to five letter words to even seven letter words and so on. Also, a class that at @CAPS4. information processing, is about computer. Once we were finished with our assignments, we could play type to learn @NUM2. That is also a typing game. As you can see, some games can teach us how to type. Another type of games where you need guide-thinking to be able to win. This teaches nto be ready for almost anything. Also, it teaches us to process what is around you and decide in a decision. In real-life situations you @MONTH1 only have a few seconds to react. Games such as these help in real-life situations. The last type of game is the tower defense. This shows us teenager to think like our lives depended on it. If we were to evr join the army and become some sort of captain, we would be able to organize our trops in the best mannor we could think of these tower defense games also teach us think and plan ahead. In these types of games, it costs money to bag upgrades buy @LOCATION1 towers. One decision is to either buy a weaker upgrade now or save for a stronger one in a little bit. Tower defense games make us make better decisions. Games @MONTH1 be fun, but they teach us skills too. Lastly, computer make things easier and have images on @ORGANIZATION2.

One reason would be not get exercise going on the computer all day, you will only get worse. Say if you were @NUM1 years old and when computers come out you bought one and went on it every day instead of being fit. Then if you have no exersize then you will get bigger and bigger. Another reason if you would only use computers for research I say this because there is no reason to go on your computer all day a good reason to go on the computer would be if you have some kind of project for school or a job instead of just using your computer for facebook or myspace. Then there is some kind of diesese that can happen to your if it does the same thing to many times. Your dont want to do that because if you dont use computer that much and you play some kind of sport like football, baseball, or any other kind of around some place. Also if kind of surgery on it and that will cause you from doing almost everything with that one hand. My last reason go on the computer your viruses connected to it. If you do that then mabe your computer will lost everything on it. Then you have to get a new computer and everything all. If you bought a new computer and you got somebody can hack your computer and get all of the information from it. The information then they like how. And if you dont know person you dont know what they can do. So I hope you dont buy something that has a really bad virus else like that.

      "ai_reason": "The text partially meets the criteria. It presents a clear opinion that computers are helpful and provides specific examples of how computers are used for school assignments, jobs, and communication. However, the examples and arguments are somewhat disjointed and lack depth. The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of computers' role in society but is inconsistent in maintaining the main argument and does not fully elaborate on the impacts. The overall message is understandable, but the text could be more cohesive and detailed.",

      "essay_text": "In my opinion having computer is good to have. Therefore I think having computers are a good thing because nowadays computers are very useful. Also a lot of people are using the for there businesses. My there reasons are to look up information, home work, and to talk to friends and family online. My first reason is to look up information on the computer. If you have thred reports to do it will best to use a computer to look up the information because it will be easier and faster to do. For an example using the internent will be faster then looking for it in a book. For that it will take at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes for the interenant if you were to lookingit in a book it can take at least @NUM3 to @NUM4 minutes. My second reason is to you could talk to your friends and family online like if one of your relatives live long distance like in @LOCATION2 then you can talk to them on your telephone or cellphone because the bill will outragouse. Or if you talk to your friends online so can ask them a question on homework or whats the homework? Like if you have a that to like @LOCATION1 you can to online and you can talk to them. My third reason is that you can even do your homework on the computer. If you have history you can go on a website for an online book instead of bringing a book to school and back to home. Also it will be easier for that you would not have to worry about bringing your history book with to home. For the example it will take less time using the interneat the using a book it will take like @NUM5 to @NUM2 minutes using the computer then using the book for @NUM5 to @NUM8 minutes. In my conclusion using a computer is very useful and very important nowadays. My three reasons are to look up information, homework and talking online to friends and family. Even though people don't like computers or don't like to use them.",

      "ai_reason": "The text partially meets the criteria outlined in the evaluation steps. It presents a clear opinion on the positive impact of computers and provides three specific ways computers affect society: looking up information, doing homework, and communicating with friends and family. However, the arguments are not well-supported by relevant examples or personal experiences, and the main argument is somewhat repetitive rather than consistently developed. The understanding of computers and their role in society is basic but not deeply explored. The overall message is understandable, but the content lacks depth and coherence.",

      "essay_text": "Dear @CAPS1: The effects that computers have on me is that it teaches me hand-eye coordination. I learn stuff from the computer, and it is a fun thing to go on. But, I mean those are only my opinions. Well im gonna just go ahead and explain them to you. The good thing about computers is that it teaches you hand-eye coordination which helps you see better with your eyes. Also it helps you with your hands by making you learn how to catch stuff and how to react quickly with your hands. For example I was playing baseball and I couldn't catch very good and I was also learning how to use the computer and because I was able to type fast my hands reacted when I got grounders and pop fly's hit to me. So I was so happy that I lerned how to use the computer and type. But for sure the computer is the best because you can research stuff and you find out more important facts. Also you are learnen more when ever you research anything. I'll tell you one thing though, I like the computer so much because it helps me find out important details and facts about the person that I am doing my project on. Yes I know the computer is so fun because you can go on different websites such as myspace.com, youtube.com, and funnyjunk.com. I go on mspace to talk to my friends and to meet new people that's what I like about myspace I meet new people and make new friends. I go on youtube because I like to listen to music and I watch music videos on their also I watch skate board videos too cause I love to skate! But one thing for sure is that I go on funnyjunk.com to play games cause they have so much fun games that you can play. But my favorite game is @CAPS2 the hedgehog. In conclusion those are @NUM1 opinions and @NUM1 reasons to support the effects about computers. So I want you to think about some effects about computers and your opinions about computers and compare them to my opinions? But hey! That's up to you only if you want to.",
