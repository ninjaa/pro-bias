You can talk to people world wide, it helps you stay organized, and you can create very useful things like a or a power point using a computer. Talking to people world wide can be a very useful thing. Say that you have family members that live in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 you can keep in touch with them by e-mail or video chat. Also, if there is a national and nedds to talk to the other, governers around the world for advices help he can do that quickly and easily. Using a computer can also help you stay organized. For example my uncle helps file takes computer to make sure all of the files get saved and they are in the light places. Imagine all of the papers and space he would use if he had to do by hand or didnt use a computer. Computers also help teachers. Teachers enter grades, e-mail parents, and even create test or quizes and they know it will be nice and organized in the computer files instead of in paper files on their desk. Speaking of quizzes that teachers make on the computer, they can also make alot of other things like power points. Power points can help them put alot of information on the screen and it helps the students learn, which is a positive effect. If you had a small business that just started out you can make a brochure to help advertising. Lastily, you can go on microsoft excel and make a schedule that can help your employees know who has to work when, or students can know what class they have to be in at what time. In conclusion, computers are very helpful in everyday for alot of different people. Talking to worldwide can help you stay in, so you dont lose connection with your. They also have effect they help business people stay organized. Lastly, they can help teachers create test or powerpoints which helps kids learn. So in all, I would have to agree that computers have a positive effect on society. Also, doesn't typeing your newspaper articles make it more organized and quicker to print them?",

      "essay_text": "Dear @CAPS1 of my local newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. These boxes can be harmful to their users' eyes. In addition, they lead to less interaction with \u201creal\u201d people. Finally, they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. Computers are harmful to our society. For starters, computers are harmful because they are very bad for our eyes. Between the @DATE1 @DATE2 and @DATE3, doctors saw nearly a @PERCENT1 increase in eye problems that resulted in either surgery, glasses, or contacts. This can be directly associated with the overuse of personal computers. Also, studies have shown that common citizens who use these cootraptions for over four hours each day end up with an extremely deteriorated vision by the age of @NUM1. Finally, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 stated that overuse of computers have led to a very negative affect on the eyesight of their workers. It can be seen, how work gets done faster, however the cost of medical treatments actually surpasses the little extra profit gained by modernizing. Secondly, computers are harmful because they lead to less time being with \u201creal\u201d people. To begin with, studies have shown that people simply don\u2019t learn as much about their peers by talking to them through a box. Also, a study by the @ORGANIZATION1 has shown that there are roughly @PERCENT2 fewer conversations at social gatherings than just @DATE1. This is alarming because at that rate people @MONTH1 never get to know each other and the world @MONTH1 become an electronically based workspace. Finally @PERSON1, social relations professional, stated that people end up with a lack of understanding when they can\u2019t feel the emotion a person has when he/she is speaking. Sure, you can video chat, but that still does not convey the real feeling behind a person\u2019s words. Finally, computers are harmful because they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. To begin with, the lack of fresh air obtained by sitting indoors all day is very bad for lungs and can lead to premature breathing problems. Also, average people get @PERCENT3 fewer workouts, according to @CAPS4\u2019s @CAPS5, which was not likely directly influenced by overuse of computers. Finally the obesity rate has risen from next to nothing to over @NUM2 in the past ten @DATE1. Research showed that the majority of the obese patients spent excessive time on their little boxes of ten. While you might feel that this is not completely due to computers, it has been proven time and time again that these machines are the main reason behind the world\u2019s currently unhealthy lifestyle. Personal computers have a very negative effect toward the society of today. This technology has resulted in very poor eyesight in the general public. In addition, they lead to a much lower amount of social interaction. Finally, they end up forcing people into an unhealthy lifestyle. So, let the word out that computers are bad for society, and try to make the world a better place to live.",

Many times we don't even think about using computers, it just becomes a part of our dayly routine. We use computers everyday in many ways, sometimes to stay intouch with a far away friend learn about and experience faraway places, or @MONTH1 be ever to practice hand eye coordination. Computers are so benifical to our life we might not be able to live without them. Most people have experienced a friend or relitive move, when this happens not all hope is lost because with the use of you run stay in touch. Many computers nowadays have built in webcams which alows you to get more than just an email. With these systems you can actualy get an image of your fried or relative. Even oprah winfrey uses the webcam feature on computers to have people \"skype\" on to her show. In adition to this there are many other ways to stay in touch even if your computer is older and have. These reletively new \"social networking series\" include facebook, twitter, and many more. Every morning when i wake up and on sportscenter i always about what famous are posting or twitter pages. This is just another great use of computers. In this economy not many people are spending thousands of to go to a beach paradise in the but with the use of computers, you can go there virtualy. Computers are great in this aspect because they alow you to learn and experience many expensive things for. For example if you wanted to learn somthing about india, you would dn't have to go to the local library and check out a book, you could just type there are many such as this that give you access information that you could ever need. This prooves also to be valable if you are studing faraway while a paper. The computer is just a great way to get information with out every having to leave your home. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill that many people lack. It alows you to throw a baseball, play videogames, or even drive car. Many computer sceptics believe that you don't benifit from using computers but a recen study done by @LOCATION1 news and report reveals that people who use computers had @PERCENT1 better hand-eye-coordination than computers users. When driving you often need to operate the car, up the radio volume, and pass out goldfish to your kids at the same time, so this could be as where improved hand-eye cordination would be handy. Hand eye coordination is an important and this skill is further developed by the use of computers. In conclusion, computers are benificial both in hand-eye coordination and in communication, as well as in geting information or a topic. Computers are one the most significant ever and are valuble in many many ways.",

As I was going through last weeks newspapers, I saw an ad to write an article about either the negative or positive factors about computers. I am here to persuade other readers about the negative affects computers have on people. As an active member of the computer, I take part in all negative factors. People who spend more than one hour on the computer are involved in @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or playing a computer game. of those kids are too involved in their compute games. I saw this segment on @CAPS5 @NUM2 about how @PERCENT1 of all teens play on the computer atleast once when they are supposed to be homework. Computer games distract from kids learning. Kids feel that @CAPS3 is more inportant than doing math homework. Computers don't benefit to kids learning. Kids or even adults who are too involved in some use of computers don't want to talk. They feel they need to focus on winning and beating all their friends. To win, people can't talk, just focus on the game. Kids who need to win and not talk could lead to lifetime results. Being self-consious or having no social skills are the biggest lifetime results from being too involved in a computer game. That is how being too involved in computer games affects their social skills. Kids who are too involved in their computer games, don't get enough exrcersize causing obsity. Kids think they are getting exrcersize by playing but in reality they are doing nothing at all. Kids think they can't leave their game, but they can. there is always a pause button somewhere on the screen. Soon kids get addicted to playing and dont think going outside is important anymore. That is how computer games cause long term effects. In conclusion, computers have no benefits on people. Computers cause no learning to be done anti-socialism, and abesity.

People would need to travel to visit a library to research, every document, doctors notes, and building plan would have to be written by hand or on an old typewriter. Life would have been much more difficult. Today, computers allow us to communicate with one another, access the millions of websites on the internet and help with school work. Almost everyday, my mon and dad receive friend requests from long lost school friends as well as relatives and current friends. Today's computers allow the world to talk to one another and know what is going on. My dad always says \" @CAPS2 makes the world go round.\" With the social networking sites, everyone is receiving tons of @CAPS2 about one another. Another way to communicate is by video chat. All @CAPS3 computers are equipped with a video camera and you can buy one if you have a @CAPS4. This will let you see the person's face are talking to. I have heard many amazing stories about this. One is about a soldier in @LOCATION1 and his present wife back home. The doctors set up a computer equipped with video chat in the operating room and the soldier was, in a way, in two places at once. The man got to see his newborn baby and his wife. Computers can do amazing things! Another reason computers are great is their accessability to the internet. There is this cool website called @CAPS5.Dcotors.Com. If you have an illness or a symtom to something, all you have to do is type it in on the home page and it will list all the possible reasons or outcomes. It also tells you how to treat it and where to find the medicine. If we looked back in time, one would need to travel to a doctor and pay to have your problem checked out. Also computers help out immensely with school work and homework. Many teachers nowadays request or demand students to type their asignments because it is easy to read, and it is easier to correct. I also find it faster to type then print. Say that you need to research the periodic table and write down @NUM1 facts as well as all the elements. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of websites on this subject. All you need to do is type it in on google. You can also add an image by copy and pasting; which will inhance your work. Computers have helped students and teachers. Lastyly, computers (and tehn keyboards) are helping people with hand - eye coordination. Many schools are offering typing classes to try and help students. I recently searched this topic on the internet and it showed a study done by @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 that people who practice typing at least @NUM2 minutes a day, will experience increased hand-eye coordination to @PERCENT1 better. This increase would help many, people with low coordination. Today, computers are helping the world in many ways. From communication, to internet accessability, then to helping hand-eye coordination. The world would change for the worse if computers were abandoned. ",
